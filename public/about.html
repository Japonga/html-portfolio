<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Chemical Engineer, graduated at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). Ever since I had coding lessons about VBA at Ufscar, I fell in love with programming. Now I'm learning to become a full stack developer. Currently working on a startup of Research and Development of biopolymers, my area is the molecular modifications of the polymer.</p>
